# San-Francisco-311-Requests-by-Neighborhood
I used Google Data Studio to create an interactive map that shows the number of different types of San Francisco 311 service requests around the world, such as street and sidewalk cleaning, graffiti, and encampments. For example, clicking any location on the map gives the number and types of reported requests in the area.
